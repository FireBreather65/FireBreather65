## About me 🧑🏾‍💻

Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted a job in a creative field. Through the years I tried dabbling in writing, beading, origami, even piano - but when I graduated high school at 16 and discovered the field of UX design, I knew I had found my calling. I fell in love with designing interfaces and the ability to use my natural creativity to positively impact users and the world.

My past jobs have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and attention to detail - all crucial skills in my journey into UX. I’m also committed to equity-focused design, as I've found that hearing from diverse perspectives can positively impact the experience for all users.
