## About me 🧑🏾‍💻

Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted a job in a creative field. Over the years, I dabbled in writing, beading, origami, even piano - but when I graduated high school at 16 and discovered UX design, I knew I had found my calling. I fell in love with designing interfaces and using my natural creativity to positively impact users and the world.

My past jobs have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and attention to detail - all crucial skills in my UX journey. I’m also deeply committed to equity-focused design, as I've found that hearing from diverse perspectives can positively impact the experience for all users.

I’m currently working to hone my skills across various stages of the design process and am aiming to find my perfect role by mid- to late 2025. If you’re interested in connecting or hiring me, I’d love to hear from you!
